Build of game that Kevin was involved in...

Attempted vertical slice of a commercial indy game as one of our final year projects. What started as a 4 man team ended up as two of us. Challenge was to make a multiplayer dog-fighter game, procedurally generated world and build a physics engine for flight control. The games world and main assets all needed to be created by code and not by assets. Naturally, we ran out of time/manpower and things were ommitted. I had kickass plans for the geodesic sphere... One group from the year actually finished theirs and released it to steam, but I can't remember the name.

## Requirements

1. Xbox 360 Controller
2. XNA Redistributable. Added a version, but you should get directly from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914). Install that first.
3. Run CodeGangstaz.exe

## Issues
### Never got round to fixing them and XNA is now obsolete and 

1. I think the resolution selection was broken somehow in our final build. You can try various options.
2. There really isn't much to the game at all. Just fly and shoot and whatnot. Oh and you can somewhat randomise the world.

## Kevin's Code

Best found in multiplayer, watch the score screen. The game (project) was never really finished, so getting an actual score is a bit tricky. We really wanted to do so much more.
